            <h3>Portamento</h3>
            <p>
              Portamento is a type of lagato and it means sliding from one note to the next (kind of like a slide whistle). When using it on a synth, play a note normally first. When you play the next note, the pitches between the first note and the second note will be played, stopping at the second note. It is sort of a slide whistle effect. In the real world, a piano can't do something like this. But something like a trumbone or a violin can do it. To hear portamento on ZynAddSubFX, check the portamento box in the master controls. Make sure the mode is Poly. Then just click between two notes. You should hear the portamento.
