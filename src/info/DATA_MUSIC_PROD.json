          "word": "ADSR Envelope",
          "definition": "ADSR stands for Attack, Delay, Sustain, and Release. This refers to parts of an envelope signal that you can customize. This envelope is then used to modulate a parameter of another signal. Typically you use it to modulate the amplitude of a signal or the cutoff frequency of a filter. But most DAWs or synths should really allow you to modulate any parameter that you want with the envelope. The names Attack, Delay, Sustain, and Release refer to sections of this envelope and you can adjust each section to change how the parameter you are modulating is modulated. The envelope amplitude begins at zero and rises up to an initial peak. The time it takes for the envelope to rise from 0 and hit this peak is called the attack. The envelope amplitude then immediately falls from this peak and down to a sustain level. The delay is how long it takes the envelope to fall from the envelope peak to the sustain amplitude. You can adjust the sustain to be at whatever level you would like. Finally, the release is how long it takes the envelope to fall from the sustain back to 0. Depending on the envelope, there could be additional sections like pre-delay (time between t=0 and the start of the attack section) or hold (how long to hold the peak of the envelope). You can use this envelope to create cool effects if you're modulating amplitude. You could create a strumming or string effect out of a sustained instrument by having a very quick delay that falls down to a near-zero sustain level. You could create a peakless, wah sound that sounds like a note played in reverse, if you lengthen the attack time. You can use envelopes many creative ways. That is just brushing the surface.",

      "compressor": {
          "word": "Compressor",
          "definition": "Compressors are tools that control the dynamics of a sound or mix. The main reason you use them is to squash down transients so you have more control over your audio levels. Sounds can be unruly and inconsistent. For a lot of audio sources, like vocals, there is a large disparity between the loudest and quietest sounds that a singer produces (the difference in dB between the loudest and quietest levels in a mix is called the Dynamic Range). This can lead to an inconsistent feeling from a mix or sound. It also causes a problem of balancing. The quiet sounds may be too hard to hear, but turning up the whole track can make your loudest sounds clip. The compressor is a good tool for this. It has two main controls that can be adjusted: the threshold and the ratio. The threshold is set at a certain dB level. If any portion of a sound goes above this dB level, then the compressor will kick in and attenuate the portion of the sound that exceeds the threshold. But how do you control how much the sound gets attenuated? Through the ratio parameter. The ratio is an X:1 ratio where X determines how many decibels of attenuation a signal experiences per dB of signal that crosses the threshold. For example, if my ratio is 4:1 and my threshold is -14dB, every 4dB that crosses the -14dB threshold is squashed down to 1dB. If I have a -10dB signal pumping through this compressor, it will be squashed down to -13dB. A -6dB signal would be attenuated to -12dB. There are two other parameters that are worth mentioning. The attack and release levels. These are set in milliseconds. They are used to tell the compressor how much time it should wait before kicking in or cutting out. When a signal crosses the threshold parameter, the attack is the amount of time the compressor should wait before it starts attenuating the signal. When a signal drops back below the threshold level, the release is the amount of time the compressor should keep attenuating the signal before it shuts off again. Compressors are used for dynamic control, but they are also appreciated for the tonal value that they can add to a sound. Each compressor has an intrinsic effect that it applies to a sound through signal processing. Most processors/VSTs do. The effect is different for every compressor. But you can also affect the tone of an incoming signal by adjusting any of the 4 parameters mentioned earlier. The compressors main goal is not to change the tonal value of your signal, so these sound changes are subtle. They can change the punch of a sound, make a sound more thick or thin. They can be applied to a whole bus or mix to 'glue' sounds together.",

This is still the case for digital instruments, since most of them are modeled after the analog ones. Processing is most effective if you have your signal levels at 0VU, which is around -18dbFS. Getting your input sounds into this digital sweet spot before processing usually falls under the concept of 'gain staging'. You can use a VU meter and change the gain of the loudest part of a track until it, on average, hovers around 0VU. This is easier for sustained notes. For more dynamic notes, you should be more concerned with the peak. Get as close as you can to 0VU without compromising the amount of headroom you want to ultimately leave in your track.",

          "word": "Ducking",
          "definition": "When you duck a sound out of your music, you soften or completely zero the amplitude of that sound for a certain period of time. This is typically done to allow for another sound to cut through your mix. A good example of this is the kick and bass within a mix. A kick is a short burst of sound that typically has a lot of energy in the lower part of the spectrum (sub-bass, bass, low-mids). Let's imagine that we have a sustained bass note throughout the mix, which also has a lot of energy in the sub-bass and bass portions of the spectrum. The frequency content of the kick and the bass will clearly overlap and mess with each other. This can cause clarity and phase problems as the two sounds constructively and destructively interfere. You will have a lot of issues hearing your kick through the bass and the track will sound muddy. A good fix for this is to 'duck' out the bass everytime the kick hits. This will allow your kick to cut through the bass and make it much easier to hear. You can duck out the bass in a subtle way - just enough for that kick to cut through. Or you can duck out the bass by a lot and introduce a pumping effect into your mix. The example given is typically done through side chaining, but can also be done with an LFO. See 'sidechaining' in the vocab section and LFO vs Compressors in the notes section.",

          "definition": "Gain automation is another 'chery on top' technique that you can use to set your mix apart. Gain automation is when you use automation within your DAW to alter the gain (incoming signal before processing) of your signal in certain parts of the track. The idea here is to reduce the dynamic range of a track so that compression and your track become more consistent. You usually want to bring up lower energy portions of your track and bring down the higher energy ones so that you have an overall average energy that is the same throughout the whole track. This is a really good technique to use with compression, if it is done right. However, don't think that this is something you should do to every individual track and sample you have. In fact, you probably shouldn't. You need to make an artistic choice, because sometimes your mix will sound better with that higher dynamic range. Sometimes you really just want that peak to punch through or you want to create space with a quieter channel. There is a compromise between these two choices however. You can do gain automation to bring parts of your track up or down. But then, you can use volume automation to compensate for some of that dynamic range that you lost out on. This will obviously still alter your sound, but it is an option that you have.",

      "gainstaging": {
          "word": "Gain Staging",
          "definition": "Analog studio technology was built to process signals most effectively at 0dBVU. This value is referred to as the 'analog sweet spot'. Today's digital processing equipment and VSTs were based on these legacy analog processors, so 0dBVU is still the best place for an incoming signal to sit before processing. Therefore, before mixing, it is a good idea to adjust the gain of your track such that the loudest part of the track averages around 0dBVU. Please note that this is not a strict requirement. Some instruments are more dynamic, so it makes no sense for them to 'average' 0dBVU. In that case, you should try and get them to peak at 0dBVU. Additionally, for some instruments, like drums, it may not be possible for you to hit 0dBVU without clipping. For these hyper-dynamic instruments, you would be better suited to get as close to 0dBVU as you can without clipping. But make sure to still leave yourself some headroom. The whole point of this is to set your tracks up for processing. If your tracks are sitting around 0dBVU, then they will sound their best as they are processed by something like a compressor or equalizer. This whole process of adjusting your track gains before mixing in order to hit this 'analog sweet spot', is my preferred definition for gain staging. For some reason gain staging was one of the most confusing things to learn about. It seems like there's so many definitions for gain staging and a lot of people have different opinions about how it should be done or what it even is. The closest happy definition that I have found, is that gain staging, is anything that you do to control the levels throughout your mixing process at any point in the signal chain or mix. The goal here is make mixing an easier process. You want to control your levels so that you do not clip at any point within your signal chain. However, you also want to make sure all the elements in your mix are properly balanced and have the right energy so they are not lost or coming in too hot in the rest of the mix. There are a couple of other definitions that I have found for gain staging. One is the idea that your processors should not add any gain to your tracks. If you have an X dBVU sound going into a processing VST, then X dBVU should be coming out. This has to do with the fact that louder sounds sound better to our ears. So you want to make sure that the sound coming out sounds better because of the processor - not just because it's louder. The idea of adjusting the makeup gains of VSTs within your processing chain so that the output signal has the same dBVU as the input signal, is also something that I've seen fall under the idea of gain staging. One other definition I have seen for gain staging is relevant to actually recording songs with real instruments and singers. The various techniques that you can do during recording to make sure your recordings don't clip and are ready for processing can also be referred to as gain staging. I can't really go too in depth here, as I don't have much experience with physically recording instruments and people. Although definitions can vary widely, gain staging, at the end of the day, is just adjusting the gain of your tracks and processing chain to make sure your tracks can be processed effectively and sound their best.",

It is important to note that this is a contextual definition. Not everyone will go by this convention and volume and gain can be used interchangebly and to label different things.

Reverb can pull an instrument or track back into the mix. If you use too much on an important track, your track won't stand out from the rest of the mix as much as you'd like. There are a couple of techniques you can do to avoid this. Don't overdo it on the reverb. Plain and simple. Sometimes it is best for the reverb to be more of a psycho-acoustic effect, such that the reverb itself is difficult to notice until it is removed. Find a sweet spot for the reverb. Another thing you can do is use a delay instead of a reverb. Delays can give you a reverb-like sound without pulling the track back from the forefront of the mix. 2. Using too much reverb will add mud to your mix and put more strain on your CPU when using your DAW. Most of the time, you shouldn't put reverbs on everything and you should adjust the reverb parameters such that you don't have tons of sustained reflections everywhere, clouding up your mix. A good technique is to have one or two reverb buses. Reverb buses can prevent you from overloading your CPU, since you won't have like 20 reverb VSTs on 20 different tracks. They will also tie/glue your mix together. Instruments will feel as if they are being played within the same space. And above all, it makes your life easier. Rather than having to adjust 1000 different knobs on different reverb VSTs, you have one consistent place where you can play with the reverb parameters.",

There are different kinds of synthesis, like additive synthesis, in which a unique sound is created by adding together modulated waveforms from different sources/oscillators.\n\nSynthesizers vary, but many of them include a set of standard tools that you can use for synthesis: LFOs, ADSR/Transient ramp modulators, AM, FM, PM, & Ring modulators, and oscillators (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, etc...). These tools give you a lot of flexibility to manipulate every aspect of a waveform and its corresponding sound.",

The whole point of this technique is to create or reduce energy within a song and direct the user's attention to a certain element in a track. This technique is definitely a cherry on top of your mix. It is not essential, but sprinkling some volume automation throughout your mix can really set you apart and push you past that line to the next level. Listen to your mix. If there are certain instruments that you feel should be louder in some portions of the track, even if it's for a second, then bring them up. This helps create energy, fill empty space, and direct the user to focus on that particular element. You can do this by hand or add automation in your DAW to do this.",

You control how much of this eventually makes it into the mix using faders on your mixing console. Contrast this with gain, which is the level of the signal before going through the signal chain. It is important to note that this is a contextual definition. Not everyone will go by this convention and volume and gain can be used interchangebly and to label different things. This distinction between volume and gain is good to have when you're doing something like gain staging.",
