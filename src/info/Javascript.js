              Node is a runtime environment for javascript. It allows you to execute javascript code outside of the context of a browser. It also introduces
              a very convenient moduling system. It allows you to break down a project into modules/files and organize them to create cleaner and more
              maintainable projects.
              NPM (Node Package Manager) is often used in conjunction with node to install pre-written and battle-tested libraries/modules from the community. NPM
              along with Node changed the way that javascript can be used in programming projects.
