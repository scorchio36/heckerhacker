          <p>
          Welcome to my website! :D <br/><br/>

          When working and studying, I tend to jump between topics very frequently. This often leads to losing resources and forgetting about the vocabulary in that field when I eventually come back to it. I hope that this website will help me minimize that loss. I will keep all of my resources and findings on this site, whether it be for physics, programming, electrical engineering, etc, Or just any other topic/event that I may find interesting. If you've somehow stumbled upon my site and are curious, please make yourself at home and use/download whatever resources you'd like. <br/><br/>

          I am always learning and always make mistakes, so please take all of the information I post here with a grain of salt. If you find any errors, please reach out to me through the contact page!
          </p>
